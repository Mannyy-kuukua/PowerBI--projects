#  Banking Saving and Loan Analysis


## 📌 Project Overview

### The analysis explores 26 years of banking data (1995–2021) to uncover insights on savings, loans, and client acquisition trends, as well as how demographics and bank types influence overall performance.

### The goal of this project was not only to design a dashboard but to tell a story with data — identifying trends, correlations, and strategic recommendations that can support decision-making in the banking sector.

## 🎯 Objectives

#### Assess if income levels and savings are correlated.

#### Track the total number of clients over 26 years.

#### Analyze loan distribution and deposit accumulation by bank type.

#### Compare savings and loan uptake by nationality.

#### Identify trends and patterns in savings, loans, and client acquisition.
# 🔍 Key Insights
## 1. Savings & Loans Trends

#### Savings showed continuous growth from 2000, but dipped in 2010 and 2017, before peaking in 2020 and then declining.

#### Loans followed a similar path, with dips in 2010 and 2016, rising sharply in 2017, peaking in 2020, and then declining in 2021.

#### Client acquisition was strongly correlated with these patterns — every savings dip matched a drop in client intake.

## 2. Bank Segments

#### Private banks accumulated the highest deposits and issued the most loans.

#### Institutional banks accumulated the least deposits and gave out the fewest loans.

#### Commercial banks had the smallest client base compared to private banks.

## 3. Demographics

### Europeans form the largest client base, holding the highest savings and accounting for 44% of total loans acquired.

### Africans represent the lowest savings and loan uptake.

## 📈 Recommendations

### Expand financial inclusion efforts in Africa to balance savings and loan contributions.

#### Diversify loan products to address the needs of underrepresented demographics.

#### Strengthen client acquisition strategies during recovery periods (similar to post-2017 and 2020 growth).

#### Reduce reliance on European clients to minimize concentration risk.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

### Power BI → Data visualization, dashboards, trend analysis.


## 🚀 Conclusion

### This project demonstrated how Power BI can transform raw banking data into actionable insights that reveal client behavior, market trends, and areas of risk. Beyond dashboards, the true value lies in data storytelling — turning numbers into meaningful narratives that drive strategic decisions.
